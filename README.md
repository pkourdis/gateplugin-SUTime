# gateplugin-SUTime

A [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk) processing resource plugin to annotate documents with [TIMEML's TIMEX3](http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/tempeval2-trial/guidelines/timex3guidelines-072009.pdf) tags using the Stanford Temporal Tagger [SUTime](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sutime.shtml) Java library. SUTime is a deterministic rule-based temporal tagger for recognizing and normalizing temporal expressions developed by the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu). It is described in detail in the paper: 

Angel X. Chang and Christopher D. Manning. 2012. [SUTIME: A Library for Recognizing and Normalizing Time Expressions](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/lrec2012-sutime.pdf). *8th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012).*
